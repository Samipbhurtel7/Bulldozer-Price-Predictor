# Bulldozer-Price-Predictor
In this project, I am doing a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Since we're trying to predict the number, its a kind of regression task.

The data and evaluation metric used in this project is (root mean square log error or RMSLE) is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

The techniques used in the project is adapted from fast.ai machine learning course.
